# Tax Sahi Hai - Kubernetes Deployment Guide

This document provides instructions for deploying the Tax Sahi Hai application on Kubernetes. The architecture is designed to be scalable, resilient, and maintainable, with a one-click deployment process.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:

1. A Kubernetes cluster (GKE, AKS, EKS, or self-managed)
2. Kubectl installed and configured
3. Helm 3.x installed
4. Docker registry for storing application images
5. Domain name configured with DNS settings

## System Architecture

Tax Sahi Hai consists of multiple microservices:

- **Frontend**: React application for user interface
- **Auth Service**: Authentication and authorization
- **Member Service**: Member management and operations
- **Document Service**: Document management and storage
- **AI Service**: Tax filing assistance with AI
- **Payment Service**: Subscription and payment processing

## Deployment Process

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/taxsahihai.git
cd taxsahihai
```

### 2. Prepare Configuration

Create a `values-production.yaml` file to override default settings:

```bash
cp charts/values.yaml charts/values-production.yaml
```

Edit the file to set production values including:
- Domain name
- Database credentials
- Storage configuration
- API keys (Stripe, OpenAI, etc.)

### 3. Build and Push Docker Images

Set up CI/CD pipeline or manually build and push images:

```bash
# Example for building and pushing frontend
docker build -t your-registry/taxsahihai-frontend:latest ./frontend
docker push your-registry/taxsahihai-frontend:latest

# Repeat for each service
docker build -t your-registry/taxsahihai-auth-service:latest ./services/auth
docker push your-registry/taxsahihai-auth-service:latest

# Continue for other services...
```

### 4. Deploy Infrastructure Dependencies

```bash
# Add required Helm repositories
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
helm repo add elastic https://helm.elastic.co
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update

# Create namespace
kubectl create namespace taxsahihai
```

### 5. Deploy with Helm (One-Click Deployment)

```bash
helm install taxsahihai ./charts/taxsahihai \
  --namespace taxsahihai \
  -f charts/values-production.yaml
```

This single command will deploy:
- All application microservices
- PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases
- Redis for caching
- Elasticsearch for search
- MinIO for document storage
- Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring

### 6. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check all pods are running
kubectl get pods -n taxsahihai

# Check services
kubectl get svc -n taxsahihai

# Check ingress
kubectl get ingress -n taxsahihai
```

## Scaling the Application

Tax Sahi Hai is designed to scale horizontally. To scale individual components:

```bash
kubectl scale deployment taxsahihai-frontend --replicas=4 -n taxsahihai
kubectl scale deployment taxsahihai-member-service --replicas=3 -n taxsahihai
```

For automatic scaling, configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler:

```bash
kubectl autoscale deployment taxsahihai-frontend --min=2 --max=10 --cpu-percent=70 -n taxsahihai
```

## Backup and Recovery

### Database Backups

Configure automated backups for PostgreSQL and MongoDB:

```bash
# For PostgreSQL using Helm values
postgresql:
  backup:
    enabled: true
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"
    destination: s3://taxsahihai-backups/postgres
    s3:
      accessKey: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
      secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
      bucket: "taxsahihai-backups"
```

### Document Storage Backups

Configure MinIO to replicate documents to S3 or other object storage:

```bash
minio:
  replication:
    enabled: true
    destination: "s3://taxsahihai-backup-bucket"
    accessKey: "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
    secretKey: "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
```

## Monitoring and Logging

The deployment includes:

- **Prometheus** for metrics collection
- **Grafana** for visualization
- **Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK)** for centralized logging

Access Grafana at: https://metrics.yourdomain.com
Default dashboards include:
- System metrics
- API performance
- Business metrics (members, documents, etc.)

## Security Considerations

1. **Network Policies**: Implemented to restrict traffic between services
2. **Secrets Management**: All sensitive credentials stored as Kubernetes secrets
3. **RBAC**: Role-based access control for Kubernetes resources
4. **TLS**: All communications encrypted with TLS
5. **Regular Updates**: Automated security patches

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

### Services Not Starting

Check logs:
```bash
kubectl logs deployment/taxsahihai-frontend -n taxsahihai
```

### Database Connection Issues

Verify environment variables:
```bash
kubectl describe pod -l app=taxsahihai-auth-service -n taxsahihai
```

### Ingress Problems

Check ingress configuration:
```bash
kubectl get ingress -n taxsahihai
kubectl describe ingress taxsahihai-ingress -n taxsahihai
```

## Upgrade Process

To upgrade the application:

1. Update Helm values file with new image tags
2. Run Helm upgrade:
```bash
helm upgrade taxsahihai ./charts/taxsahihai \
  --namespace taxsahihai \
  -f charts/values-production.yaml
```
